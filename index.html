    <p class="about">Ariel has grown up in Vermont for most of his life and is currently living in Williston. From a young age he's been interested in art, starting out with traditional artwork using pencil in sketchbooks. His interest in art has evolved from there, and he is now working with programs such as Procreate and Adobe Illustrator to create artwork digitally. His work ranges from logos to character designs. He's taken a few art classes/camps over the years and is always looking for new techniques to try. He started to learn 3D modeling and animating in Blender then importing those models into videogames using engines such as Unreal.  </p>

        <p>I have four dogs, Hudson (a chocolate lab), Millie (a Norwich Terrier), and Manu and Fia who are both mixed breeds. All of them are pretty active and we go on hikes together.</p>

        <div class="para2">
        <p>I've done horseback riding ever since I was 6 years old, and own a horse named Belle. I used to do a horseback riding camp every summer where we would learn new things, help out a ton on the farm, and with the animals. I've taken many lessons and learnt how to canter, jump, etc. </p>
    </div>

        <div class="para3">
        <p>Another sport I enjoy is skiing. Similar to horseback riding I've done it ever since i was little. I love being able to spend time with my family skiing all day and then going inside for hot chocolate.</p>
